## XIAOJING LI
HELLO!

I am a postgraduate student at University of Glasgow's
[Institute of Neuroscience and Psychology](http://www.gla.ac.uk/researchinstitutes/neurosciencepsychology/) and under supervision of [EstherPapies](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/psychology/staff/estherpapies/). To read her work and download publications, see [Esther Papies's website](http://healthycognitionlab.org/). 

My dissertation mainly focuses on the role of decentering through meditation experiences on resilience of stressful events and perceived academic stress among university students. My undergraduate focused on the relationship of academic idendity between different academic disciplines and mental health. So, the main area of my research is university students' mental health and psychological wellbeing in a university level. You can contact me via email if you have questions.
